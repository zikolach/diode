This is a bit more complex example application using Diode. It features a hierarchical data structure representing a directory tree.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository from GitHub
1. Build Diode artifacts and publish them locally `sbt publichLocal` from root folder
1. Run `sbt "~fastOptJS"` in the `examples/treeview` directory
1. Wait for update/compilation to complete (you'll see `1. Waiting for source changes... (press enter to interrupt)`)
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html](http://localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html)
1. Press `Enter` in console to quit
